# **Greetings,**
I got an interest to do computer programming in the year 2012. After my graduation in 2016, I worked for iOS app development and then I left my job at 2018 and started full time freelancing alongside I am spending time to build a utility that **least of us** needs.

I do open source projects, blogs, innovative techniques and taking photos of nature. You can find them at [https://rajamohan.dev/](https://rajamohan.dev/)

Thank you, Have a nice day.
